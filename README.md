# Landing Page Project

This project is a simple landing page created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The main goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS, with a special focus on using Flexbox for layout.

## About The Project

The landing page has a simple, clean design with a header, a hero section, an information section, a quote, and a call-to-action section. The theme of the page revolves around nature and geometry.


### Built With

*   HTML
*   CSS (Flexbox)

## What I Learned

This project was a great opportunity to solidify my understanding of Flexbox. I learned how to use it to create responsive layouts and align elements effectively. I practiced using properties like `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-direction`, and `gap`.
